When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. Never Resting. The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons. All men must die. You know nothing, Jon Snow. A Lannister always pays his debts. The Knight of Lemonwood. Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne. The War of the 5 kings. Dunc the Lunk, thick as a castle wall. And now his watch is ended. Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne. The tourney of Ashford Meadows. I would like a trial by combat. The winds of Winter. Winter is coming. The War of the 5 kings. The winds of Winter. The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons.
